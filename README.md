PostgreSQL Version Manager - pgvm
==================================

PostgreSQL Version Manager, or simply `pgvm` is a tool to manage multiple PostgreSQL installations.

Installation
------------

To install just type:

    curl -s -L https://raw.github.com/guedes/pgvm/master/bin/pgvm-self-install | bash

Then open a new terminal or type:

    source ~/.bashrc

and voilÃ !

An example session
------------------

Once you installed `pgvm` you could like to see which
PostgreSQL versions were installed. In fact the `pgvm`
installation didn't install any.

You list all PostgreSQL installed version with the
action `list`:

    $ pgvm list
    Please, install a PostgreSQL Version!

As you can see, there isn't any. Lets install one
using the action `install`:

    $ pgvm install 9
    downloading 'http://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/source/v9.2.0/postgresql-9.2.0.tar.gz', please be patient... done.
    checking 'postgresql-9.2.0.tar.gz' integrity... done.
    extracting postgresql-9.2.0.tar.gz ... done.
    configuring PostgreSQL Version: 9.2.0 ... done.
    compiling ... done.
    installing ... done.

Notice that the version supplied was `9` but `pgvm`
found that the last PostgreSQL version is `9.2.0`.

Now suppose we want to install the `8.4.11` version
with `cassert` enabled, using more cores of our
processors, just export `MAKE_OPTS` and `CONFIG_OPTS`
with the options for `make` and `configure` respectively,
like bellow:

    $ MAKE_OPTS="-j 10" CONFIG_OPTS="--enable-cassert" pgvm install 8.4.11
    downloading 'http://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/source/v8.4.11/postgresql-8.4.11.tar.gz', please be patient... done.
    checking 'postgresql-8.4.11.tar.gz' integrity... done.
    extracting postgresql-8.4.11.tar.gz ... done.
    configuring PostgreSQL Version: 8.4.11 ... done.
    compiling ... done.
    installing ... done.

So now you have two PostgreSQL versions installed:

    $ pgvm list
    PostgreSQL Installed Version:

        8.4.11
        9.2.0

Then `pgvm` allow you `use` one of them:

    $ pgvm use 92.0
    version 92.0 is not installed

Ops! A little typo, sorry! :/

    $ pgvm use 9.2.0
    switched to 9.2.0

Ah! So now my `current` version is `9.2.0`? Well
lets just confirm:

    $ pgvm current
    9.2.0

    $ pgvm list
    PostgreSQL Installed Version:

        8.4.11
     => 9.2.0

Seems that `pgvm` tell us in two ways, by the
action `current` or when listing version by
placing a `=>` before the version we are using!

The binaries are there in the correct version:

    $ pg_config --version
    PostgreSQL 9.2.0

    $ psql --version
    psql (PostgreSQL) 9.2.0

    $ pgvm use 8.4.11

    $ pg_config --version
    PostgreSQL 8.4.11

    $ psql --version
    psql (PostgreSQL) 8.4.11

Ok, this is nice but how about clusters? Lets
create one!

    $ pgvm use 9.2.0
    switched to 9.2.0

    $ pgvm cluster list
    there is no clusters in current environment (9.2.0)

    $ pgvm cluster create my_cluster
    initializing cluster in '/home/guedes/pgvm/clusters/9.2.0/my_cluster'... ok!

    $ pgvm cluster start my_cluster
    starting cluster my_cluster@9.2.0
    LOG:  database system was shut down at 2012-09-22 21:55:03 UTC
    LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
    LOG:  autovacuum launcher started

    $ pgvm cluster list
    cluster in current enviroment (9.2.0):

        my_cluster  is online  at port 5433

    $ pgvm cluster create my_another_cluster
    initializing cluster in '/home/guedes/pgvm/clusters/9.2.0/my_another_cluster'... ok!

    $ pgvm cluster start my_another_cluster
    starting cluster my_another_cluster@9.2.0
    LOG:  database system was shut down at 2012-09-22 21:55:06 UTC
    LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
    LOG:  autovacuum launcher started

    $ pgvm cluster list
    cluster in current enviroment (9.2.0):

        my_another_cluster is online  at port 5434
        my_cluster         is online  at port 5433

Now we have two online clusters and notice that
`pgvm` choose specific ports to each one.

You can pass options to `initdb` when creating
a new cluster:

    $ pgvm use 8.4.11
    switched to 8.4.11

    $ pgvm cluster create latin1_cluster --encoding=latin1 --locale=en_US

And you can remove some cluster

    $ pgvm cluster create to_be_removed
    initializing cluster in '/home/guedes/pgvm/clusters/8.4.11/to_be_removed'... ok!

    $ pgvm cluster start to_be_removed
    starting cluster to_be_removed@8.4.11
    LOG:  database system was shut down at 2012-09-22 21:55:13 UTC
    LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
    LOG:  autovacuum launcher started

    $ pgvm cluster remove to_be_removed
    To remove cluster 'to_be_removed' use  'pgvm cluster remove to_be_removed --force'

    $ pgvm cluster remove to_be_removed --force
    stopping cluster to_be_removed@8.4.11
    LOG:  received smart shutdown request
    LOG:  autovacuum launcher shutting down
    LOG:  shutting down
    LOG:  database system is shut down
    removing 'to_be_removed' directory '/home/guedes/pgvm/clusters/8.4.11/to_be_removed' ... ok

Maybe you are a PostgreSQL developer and wants to install from
`master` branch ...

    $ pgvm install master
    getting postgres from 'git://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git'
    Cloning into '/home/guedes/pgvm/src/postgresql-clone'...
    configuring PostgreSQL Version: master ... done.
    compiling ... done.
    installing ... done.

    $ pgvm use master
    switched to master

    $ pgvm cluster create cl_test_master
    initializing cluster in '/home/guedes/pgvm/clusters/master/cl_test_master'... ok!

    $ pgvm cluster start cl_test_master
    starting cluster cl_test_master@master
    LOG:  database system was shut down at 2012-09-22 21:58:49 UTC
    LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
    LOG:  autovacuum launcher started

    $ pgvm cluster list
    cluster in current enviroment (master):

        cl_test_master  is online  at port 5436

... or from a specific commit to test something ...

    $ pgvm install 088c065
    configuring PostgreSQL Version: 088c065 ... done.
    compiling ... done.
    installing ... done.

    $ pgvm use 088c065
    switched to 088c065

    $ pgvm cluster create cl_test_other
    initializing cluster in '/home/guedes/pgvm/clusters/088c065/cl_test_other'... ok!

    $ pgvm cluster start cl_test_other
    starting cluster cl_test_other@088c065
    LOG:  database system was shut down at 2012-09-22 22:01:06 UTC
    LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
    LOG:  autovacuum launcher started

    $ pgvm cluster list
    cluster in current enviroment (088c065):

        cl_test_other  is online  at port 5437

By the way, you can start a console on any cluster:

    $ pgvm current
    088c065

    $ pgvm console my_cluster@9.2.0
    connecting to cluster 'test' on port '5433' ...

    psql (9.2.0)
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=#

Or you can redirect commands to:

    $ echo "select version()" | pgvm console latin1_cluster@8.4.11
    connecting to cluster 'test' on port '5435' ...

                                               version
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
